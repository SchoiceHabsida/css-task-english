# Task for determining the level of layout knowledge

![Template](/template.jpg)

If you have no knowledge of layout, you can start learning from scratch.

### Recommended Code Editors
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

### You need to create a layout based on the screenshot without using any libraries or frameworks.

- Without using libraries and frameworks, minification is not required, and JavaScript is not needed (hint: the text after "Individual / Business / ..." does not change).
- Perfect pixel-perfect is not required, but it should generally match the image.
- You can use preprocessors if you want.
- If you don't know how to create something from scratch, you can skip it.
- Images for reference are located in the img folder.
- Use this font https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/barlow
- Create responsive layout if you can.
- If you know how, add animations for hover/focus effects as you see fit.
